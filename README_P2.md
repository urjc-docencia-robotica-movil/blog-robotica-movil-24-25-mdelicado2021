# FOLLOW LINE P2
The aim of this practice is to make a controller for a racing car to follow a red line to complete the circuit.

## Code structure
The code is divided into several parts. Firstly, I have given it a fixed speed in order to test the mask for detecting the red line.
In addition, I have created the velocity control functions (linear and angular) but, for the moment, with constant velocities in order to, for the moment, not to take into account the
the error with respect to the red line.
